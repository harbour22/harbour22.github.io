A simple GitHub pages site to capture my thoughts, notes and maybe even an opinion or two.  Topics will include (but not limited to) software engineering, photography, cars, finance and possibly maths if I ever finish my Coursera courses.

For every update made here, my focus is on the journey rather than the destination.  This site represents a record of these journeys. 

Kudos to [Michael Rose](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/) for the wonderful Jekyll theme that underpins this site.

I was curious to see what support there was for mathematical symbols on GitHub Pages.  It seems that the following syntax is supported but a little unclear from the documentation

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

If there is nothing between the first paragraph and this line then rendering hasn’t work.

This post will evolve.

I was curious to see what support there was for mathematical symbols on GitHub Pages.  It seems that the following syntax is supported but a little unclear from the documentation

$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

If there is nothing between the first paragraph and this line then rendering hasnâ€™t worked (we should be able to see a^2 + b^2 = c^2)

This post will evolve.

I was curious to see what support there was for mathematical symbols on GitHub Pages.  It seems that the following syntax is supported but a little unclear from the documentation

$\underbrace{a+b+c}_{\text{note}}$

If there is nothing between the first paragraph and this line then rendering hasn’t work.

This post will evolve.

Measuring the passage of, and where we spend time on a daily basis is difficult.  The goal of this site is to capture my thoughts (and notes) on some of the technologies, processes, maths and finance topics I end up spending that time looking at.

In itself it also allows me to familiarise myself with [GitHub Pages pages](https://pages.github.com), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

Hopefully over a long enough timeline this becomes a useful repository, or at the very least a record of where some of my time was spent.
